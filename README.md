# IDispatcher ASP.NET Core Project
=============================================

IDispatcher is my web project defence for the module ASP.NET Core in SoftUni.
It is a website for freelancers, employers and customers, with a forum and blog section.

 - Razor template engine for generating the UI
 - Sections and partial views
 - MVC Areas
 - User roles
 - Web APIs,
 - Caching
 - Error handling and data validation 
 - Prevent from security vulnerabilities like SQL Injection, XSS, CSRF, parameter tampering, etc.
 - The best practices for Object-Oriented design and high-quality code 
 - Microsoft SQL Server as Database Service and Entity Framework Core to access your database
 - Unit Tests
